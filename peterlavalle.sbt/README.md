This is (or should be) a public mirror of my big-pile-of-rubbish basecode.

Might be something interesting here.
Might not.

I'm taking no responsibilities at this point; fund my PhD and we can work something out?

# Release

1. commit and merge into `default`
1. add a message (on default) with `[deploy]` in it to build and upadte the full m2-repo system
4. otherwise, add `[mirror]` to the commit message to "just" trigger a re-mirroring of the source code
3. publik blog posts are always deployed
5. ... and Jenkins will need to be running properly for this to work. best that you check before creating the commits, since, the same checks are always run
